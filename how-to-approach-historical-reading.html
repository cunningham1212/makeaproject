      <h2>Picking A Topic That Interests You</h2>
      <p>Let’s be real a second (for just a millisecond). If you pick a topic that you aren’t interested in, you aren’t going to have fun. <i>At all.</i> Try to find something in history that interests you, like the American Civil War or something more obscure that you randomly stumbled upon like outlaws in Australia. So step one is to find something that you actually want to understand better. There’s nothing worse than losing interest in a book halfway through or a sentence into the first chapter.</p>

       <h2>Nonfiction History VS Historical Fiction</h2>
         <p>Historical reading also depends on whether or not you want to read nonfiction history or historical fiction. It’s quite intense figuring out which one you actually want to read. If you want to read the Wikipedia articles on them the historical fiction article is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction#Historical_novel">here</a> and the nonfiction article is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fiction">here</a>. But, to sum up, historical fiction is where the story is mostly true but has fictionalized accounts, dialogue, and characters while nonfiction has all the actual facts, accounts, and happenings.</p>
        
        <hr />
      
       <h2>Choosing The Book</h2>
       
       <p>I will admit that it takes some time to choose the right style of writing you like and to find authors that you love. But stick with it! Historical reading can be <i>gasp, shudder,</i> fun if you find the right things. So, to find a good book that you’ll enjoy, browse through whatever section, authors, or list of books and authors you made and read the blurbs of them. If you find one that captures your interest, try it! You might like it, and if not, that’s ok. Take it from someone who’s spent a <i>lot</i> of time trying to find the right books: it takes time. Historical reading isn’t for everyone, so don’t feel bad about not getting into it. But at least try it, because you might really love it!</p>
