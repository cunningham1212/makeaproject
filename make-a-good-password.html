                  <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
		  <blockquote>You’ll need a website you want to use a secure password with and a knowledge of relatively obscure words. The most important accounts are the ones you use to sign into other services. If, for example, you use the “Sign In With Google” button a lot and use a lot of google serives, make that your most secure password (duh).</blockquote>

      <h2>What is a secure password?</h2>
      <p>Okay, in order to understand what makes a password secure, you need to know how they are broken. There are three methods.</p>
      
      <p>The first method is that you “brute force”. Someone makes a bot that just sits there and goes through every combination possible. It is a bunch of combinations, however computers are really fast at these types of computations. But, as your password gets longer, it takes exponentially more time to guess it. The longer it is, the safer it is.</p>
      
      <p>The second method is that you “dictionary attack”. Instead of making a bot that goes through characters, it goes through words instead (if you think you are going to be clever and replace an o for a 0, they include that as well). The more you stay away from super common words, the safer your password is.</p>
      
      <p>The third method is the least common, but still dangerous. Instead of going through random words, they might go through words or phrases about you like your birthday, name, family names, etc. It is also common to test words related to the website you are saving the password for. For example, on a jewelry website, they would check for words like “pretty” and “diamond”. The more topically obscure the words are, the better.</p>

		  <h2>How do I make a secure password?</h2>
         <p>But who are we kidding? You aren’t going to remember that! So what does a practical secure password look like?</p>
         
         <p>margaret Tha_tcher is 110% Co!mmunist</p>
         
         <p>So let's go through how to make something like this. Pick four obscure-ish words. Feel free to be creative on this. Use names of relatively (but hopefully not too) famous people, use chemical compound names, etc. Use obscure words like “Communist”. Try to make it a memorable phrase.</p>
         
         <a href="http://www.wordcount.org/main.php">This is a great resource to actually quantify how obscure each word is.</a>
         
         <p>That leaves us with something like: margaret Thatcher is Communist</p>

        <p>Notice: Include spaces! Be weird with capitalizing!</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>Now let’s add numbers and other special characters.</p>

        <p>margaret Thatcher is 110% Communist</p>
      
      <hr />
      
        <p>Great, one last step, throw in random characters to make sure they won't show up in the hacker’s dictionary.</p>

        <p>margaret Tha_tcher is 110% Co!mmunist</p>
      
      <p>That's it! There isn't much to it!</p>
      
      <hr />
      
       <h2>What are other ways to keep my things secure?</h2>
       
       <p>Websites such as Google are great at notifying you when it thinks a login was strange. So, make sure when you get an email like that to actually change your password. Also, it’s just good practice to change your password every year or so. If you really do what to keep your things secure, check to see if the services offers two factor authentication. In addition to your password, the service will text you a code that you will need to input to access your account.</p>
